## What is touch?

The touch command is mainly used to:

Create empty files.

Update file timestamps (access time and modification time)

It does not open the file for editing like cat, vi, or nano.

## Usage

## 1. Create an empty file

touch file1.txt

ðŸ‘‰ If file1.txt doesnâ€™t exist, it creates it as an empty file.

## 2. Create multiple files at once

touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt

ðŸ‘‰ Creates all three empty files in the current directory.

## 3. Update timestamp of a file

touch file1.txt

ðŸ‘‰ If the file already exists, touch wonâ€™t change its content but updates the last modified time to the current time.

Check using:

ls -l file1.txt

## 4. Change timestamp to a custom date/time

touch -t 202309041230 file1.txt

Sets modification time to 4 Sept 2023, 12:30.
Format: [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss]

## 5. Prevent creation (only update if exists)

touch -c file1.txt

ðŸ‘‰ Wonâ€™t create a new file if it doesnâ€™t exist, just updates time if it exists.


## ey Difference (vs cat)

touch file.txt â†’ creates an empty file (0 bytes).

cat > file.txt â†’ creates file and lets you add content interactively.

In short:

Use touch to make empty files or update timestamps.

Use cat (or nano, vi) if you want to create and edit a fileâ€™s contents.
