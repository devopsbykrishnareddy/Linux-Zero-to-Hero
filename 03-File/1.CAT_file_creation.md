### The cat command in Linux is normally used to read/concatenate files, but you can also use it to create a file.

## Steps to Create a File Using cat

### 1. Open terminal.

### 2. Run this command:

cat > filename.txt

Replace filename.txt with the file name you want.

### 3. After pressing Enter, type the content you want inside the file. Example:

Hello, this is my first file.
This is created using cat command.

### 4. When you are done typing, press:
CTRL + D

(This ends the input and saves the file.)

## Example

cat > notes.txt
Linux is powerful.
cat can be used to create files.

Press CTRL + D.

Now check the file:

cat notes.txt

Output:

Linux is powerful.
cat can be used to create files.

### Variations

Append content to an existing file (without overwriting):

cat >> notes.txt

(type new lines, then press CTRL+D)

Create multiple files at once (empty files):

cat > file1.txt file2.txt

So the key is:

cat > filename → create or overwrite a file.

cat >> filename → append to a file.
