## What is Linux?

Linux is an open-source operating system (OS) kernel first developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991.

It acts as a bridge between hardware (CPU, memory, storage, etc.) and software (applications, services).

Unlike Windows or macOS, Linux is free, customizable, and widely used across servers, desktops, and embedded devices.


## Key Features of Linux

Open Source – Free to use, modify, and distribute.

Multi-user & Multi-tasking – Many users and processes can run simultaneously.

Security & Stability – Strong permission model, rarely crashes, widely used in enterprises.

Portable – Runs on everything: supercomputers, servers, smartphones (Android), routers, IoT devices.

Shell & Command-line Power – Provides strong CLI for automation and system management.

## Linux Architecture (High Level)

Kernel – The core that interacts with hardware.

Shell – Command interpreter for user interaction.

System Libraries – Pre-built code to help applications talk to the kernel.

User Applications – Programs like browsers, editors, and services.

## Popular Linux Distributions (Distros)

### Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, Red Hat, Arch Linux

Each distro packages the Linux kernel + system software + user interface.

## Where Linux is Used?

Servers & Cloud – Runs majority of web servers and cloud infra (AWS, Azure, GCP).

Desktops & Laptops – For developers, security experts, and power users.

Android OS – Built on top of Linux.

Supercomputers & IoT devices – Most supercomputers run Linux.
