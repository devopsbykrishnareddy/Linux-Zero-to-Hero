### step-by-step guide to (A) install VMware Workstation on your Windows 11 laptop and (B) create & install Ubuntu inside it. I’ll include the exact commands and the common troubleshooting steps. Follow the steps in order.

### Quick checklist (before you start)

Windows 11, admin access on the PC.

Internet to download installers (VMware + Ubuntu ISO).

At least 20–30 GB free disk space, and 4 GB RAM available for the VM (8 GB+ recommended if you run heavy apps).

Make sure Virtualization (VT-x / AMD-V) is enabled in firmware (BIOS/UEFI).

## A — Download installers

### VMware Workstation (Player or Pro)

Go to VMware’s desktop hypervisor page and download the appropriate Windows installer (Workstation Player if you want a free/simple option; Workstation Pro if you want extra features).

### Ubuntu Desktop ISO (recommended: LTS)

Download the Ubuntu Desktop ISO (e.g., Ubuntu 24.04 LTS or 22.04 LTS) from Ubuntu’s official site. Save the .iso file.

## Install VMware Workstation on Windows 11

### Run the VMware installer you downloaded → Right-click → Run as administrator.

Click through the installer: accept EULA, choose install location (default is fine), select shortcuts if you want, allow product updates prompt, and finish the install. Reboot if installer requests it. (Typical options are: install enhanced keyboard driver, check for updates, create shortcuts.)

Tip: If you prefer a free/simple flow, use Workstation Player; if you need snapshots, cloning, advanced networking, use Workstation Pro.


### Create a new Ubuntu VM in VMware Workstation

Open VMware Workstation → File → New Virtual Machine.

Choose Typical (recommended) → Next.

Installer disc image file (iso) → Browse → select the Ubuntu .iso you downloaded → Next.

Guest OS: Linux → Ubuntu 64-bit (VMware usually auto-detects). → Next.

Name the VM (e.g., Ubuntu-24.04) and choose VM storage location → Next.

Disk size: 20 GB minimum (30+ GB recommended). Choose Store virtual disk as a single file for slightly better performance → Next.

Before finishing click Customize Hardware:

Memory: set 4096 MB (4 GB) or higher.

Processors: 2 CPU cores (or more if host has capacity).

Network Adapter: NAT (default) or Bridged if VM must be on the same LAN as host.

CD/DVD (SATA): Ensure ISO is selected.

Optionally enable Accelerate 3D graphics if you need GUI apps with graphics.

Finish to create the VM. 


## Power on and install Ubuntu

Select the VM → Power on this virtual machine. The VM will boot the ISO and show Ubuntu’s installer.

Choose Install Ubuntu (or “Try” to test first).

Follow the installer steps:

Language & keyboard layout

Choose Download updates while installing and Install third-party software (recommended)

Installation type: Erase disk and install Ubuntu (this affects only the virtual disk)

Create your user account (username + password)

Let the installer finish → Restart the VM when prompted. If the ISO remains mounted, eject it (VM → Removable Devices → CD/DVD → Disconnect) before reboot
